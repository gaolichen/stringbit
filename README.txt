The source code for string bit projects: arXiv:1602.02166 and arXiv:1701.04806. 

We use CMake to build the C++ code. The C++ code depends on the eigen library, assuming the "eigen" folder, which contains the header files, is in the same level as the stringbit root folder.

For information about eigen library, see eigen.tuxfamily.org.

The mathematica and matlab source codes are located in mathematica and matlab folder respectively.

The results folder contains the results generated by the C++ program.
